        We began our journey as a studio during the COVID-19 pandemic, when our founder was bored out of his mind and began 3d modelling as a hobby. Since then we have expanded our into a secondary location at Menlo School and are devoting our resources to developing more high-fidelity 3d models. 
        At VDC we pride ourselves on our creator-centric design process that utilizes state of the art deep learning algorithm to assign each artist their task on a particular model. Our deepThinkâ„¢ modelling workflow helps our creators stay on track and focus on cultivating new skills.
